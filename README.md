## 🧩 Capture The Flag (CTF) Writeups

Documented walkthroughs from CTFs and final assessments from courses:

- [TryHackMe: RootMe](ctf-writeups/TryHackMe_RootMe.md)
- [HackTheBox: Easy Challenge](ctf-writeups/HackTheBox_EasyChallenge.md)
- [CDTH Final CTF – GuideM](ctf-writeups/CDTH_Final_CTF.md)

🧠 I use tools like Burp Suite, Wireshark, Nmap, and log parsers to identify malicious behavior, uncover exploits, and complete challenges.
